    VISIT CROATIA

Wanted to build something that represents beauty of my country,
shows location, accomandation, something that everyone can visit no matter 
which time of the year is.

On the navbar is available to see where Croatia is on the map, 
highlighted every nature and national park, Instagram page with 
brath taking pictures, and Bookinf, Airbnb and Tripadvisor official web pages that
will make finding accomandation a little be easier.

On homepage is available a little bit of Croatia paragraph,
and on clicking LEARN MORE you will be able to actually learn more about this country.

Next part of the page is nature park slide show.Every picture is actually a hyperlink to
offiacial homepage of every park.

After that is a table with nature parks, as well, every picture leads to the 
official web page.

In the footer is TO THE TOP button that leads you to the top.


On LEARN MORE page ("ABOUT CROATIA") is a nav bar that also point you to the
Booking, Airbnb and Tripadvisor, ,and also to the homepage.

Beneath that is where Croatia actually is, and realtions with neighbour countries.
Clicking on the picture leads to the map.
Also,there is a parahraph about out national anthem, how it was made and so.

In container on the right side is HONORABLE MENTIONS and MORE ABOUT CROATIAN HISTORY, where
you can learn more things about Croatia, like history of CRAVAT and CHECKERBOARD, or learn things
about NIKOLA TESLA and famous car maker Mate Rimac from RIMAC AUTOMOBILI.


I just wanted to represent my country as I see it, beautifull country with gorgeus nature to visit.
