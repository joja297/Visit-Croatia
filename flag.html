      <p>The Croatian flag – as shown below – was officially adopted as the flag of Croatia in December 1990 (although it had been in use since July 1990), prior to the country’s declaration of independence in June 1991.
      The red, white and blue colours – used in the flags of several Slavic countries – have actually been used in the flag of Croatia since 1848.
      Likewise, a coat of arms in the centre of the flag (although not the same one in use today)
      was also used in Croatian flags in the 19th century – an early version contains the shields of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia.
      The coat of arms in the centre of the Croatian flag is actually made up of a chequered shield with five individual coats of arms of various provinces and towns above it.
      These provinces are those from which Croatia emerged and formed. They are – from left to right – a crescent and star (the oldest known coat of arms for Croatia);
      two red stripes on blue (the coat of arms of Dubrovnik, which exists from when it was the Republic of Ragusa); three golden lion heads (the coat of arms of Dalmatia); a golden goat (the coat of arms of Istria);
      and a gold star above a black marten, a weasel-like animal (the coat of arms of Slavonia).</p>
